This simple Go program uses robotgo to simulate a numpad when using a 60% keyboard or a smaller keyboard.
There are cases when you need to use a number pad.

For example, some programs or games have shortcuts that require the numpad numbers.

Now, you can use your phone or another device with a browser to simulate key input to your host.
